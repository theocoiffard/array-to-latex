# Array To Latex script
 This Python code allows to convert a numpy array to Latex matrix with different brackets. Moreover, it is possible to have different possibilities of equation form. 
 A Jupyter notebook will be avalaible in the future to explain the different methods used. 
 Thank you and enjoy.
